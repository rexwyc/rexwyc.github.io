    <h2>About Hitler</h2>
    <p>Adolf Hitler, born on April 20, 1889, in Austria, was the leader of the Nazi Party and Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945. He rose to power by using strong speeches and propaganda to take advantage of Germany's problems after World War I.

Hitler's rule is known for its harsh policies and the Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of others were killed. His aggressive plans started World War II in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. He aimed to create a racially pure Aryan state, leading to many terrible actions across Europe.

Initially, Hitler had some military successes, but mistakes, like invading the Soviet Union and declaring war on the U.S., led to Germany's defeat. As Allied forces approached Berlin, Hitler took his own life on April 30, 1945. His legacy is marked by destruction and suffering, prompting ongoing discussions about leadership and the dangers of unchecked power. The effects of his actions continue to influence history and how we remember the past.</p>
